Data description: 

- date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
- time: time in format hh:mm:ss
- global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
<<<<<<< HEAD
    - The power that is used 
- global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
    - voltage / power that bouces back and forth between devices that is theoretically unused
- voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volts)
- global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
    - ampere is abbreviated with amp

- sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
- sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
- sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
